 ### Before You Begin 
 1. **Hit the GIPHY API**.    * Fool around with the GIPHY API. [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/).    
* Be sure to read about these GIPHY parameters (hint, hint):      * `q`      * `limit`      * `rating`    * Like many APIs, GIPHY requires developers to use a key to access their API data. 

To use the GIPHY API, you'll need a GIPHY account (don't worry, it's free!) and then obtain an API Key by [creating an app](https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/?create=true).    

* Make sure you switch the protocol in the query URL from **`http to https`**, or the app may not work properly when deployed to Github Pages.  

2. **[Watch the demo video](https://youtu.be/BqreERTLjgQ)**     * You should have a high-level understanding of how this assignment works before attempting to code it.
